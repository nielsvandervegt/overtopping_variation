# Variation in Flow Characteristics of Overtopping Waves on Dike Crests
This repository contains the Python notebooks related to the publication ['Variation in Flow Characteristics of Overtopping Waves on Dike Crests' by van der Vegt et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2025.104772).

## Data Availability
In this study, we use FlowDike data ([report](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:73cb6cbe-8931-4499-b4d6-aa31548f5dda)) postprocessed by Hughes and Nadal ([article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2008.09.005)). The data is not distributed with this repository but can be obtained from the FlowDike team.

The file `data_example.xlsx` provides an example of the data structure required to run the scripts.

## Acknowledgements
The authors would like to thank Dr. Steven A. Hughes for providing the FlowDike dataset and his analysis of individual overtopping events. We also acknowledge the FlowDike team for their efforts in conducting the experiments.
